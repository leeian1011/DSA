# DSA stuff for learning

## Big O notation.
- Used for determining the time growth as number of elements increases.<br></br>
For an example, `O(n)` assuming each operation takes 1second, the algorithm with 10 elements, will take 10 * 1 seconds to complete.
`O(log n)` on the otherhand, will take log 10 * 1 seconds to complete, this being around 3 seconds to complete.
This is shown even more dramatically when you have 1_000_000_000 elements,
Suddenly the `O(n)` algorithm takes 1_000_000_000 seconds, whilst the `O(log n)` takes (log 1_000_000_000) seconds, or a little under 30 seconds to complete. The difference is astounding.
